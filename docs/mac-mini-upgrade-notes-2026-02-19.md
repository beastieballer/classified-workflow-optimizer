# Mac mini Upgrade Research Notes

Date: 2026-02-19
Status: HOLD (revisit later)

## Decision (for now)
- Staying on current Mac mini for now.
- Revisit upgrade later.

## Current performance observations
- System showed memory pressure during active work.
- Snapshot observed:
  - CPU usage: ~60.59% user, ~20.61% sys, ~18.78% idle
  - PhysMem: ~7601M used, ~73M unused, compressor ~3081M
- Practical takeaway: RAM headroom is currently the bottleneck more than raw CPU.

## Upgrade guidance discussed
- Not mandatory to replace immediately.
- Recommended targets if upgrading:
  - Minimum worthwhile: 16GB unified memory
  - Better long-term: 24GB+
  - If local models become a priority: 32GB ideal

## Hybrid architecture discussion (Mac + VPS)
- Conclusion: keep Mac mini as primary for now.
- VPS can be evaluated later for always-on/public workloads.
- No need to remove Mac setup if adding VPS in future.

## Mac mini M4 pricing signals (US-focused)
- Common baseline signal: around $599 for base M4 configuration.
- Good promo range: ~$499–$559.
- Typical “okay” range: ~$560–$599.
- Usually pass/wait for base config when $620+.

## Retail channels to monitor
1. Apple Store (custom config, trade-in, AppleCare)
2. Best Buy
3. Costco (member promos can be strong)
4. Micro Center (location-based aggressive pricing)
5. eBay (only with strong seller vetting)

## eBay notes (live sweep summary)
- Many listings clustered around ~$540–$600 for base-like configs.
- Safer picks tend to be from high-feedback/Top Rated sellers with returns.
- Lower prices often correlated with weaker seller history/risk.

## Final pre-buy checklist (saved)
1. Confirm exact config and SKU (e.g., MU9D3LL/A for common base 16/256 listings).
2. Check seller quality (Top Rated, ~99%+ positive, real sales history).
3. Verify condition text (new/sealed) and return policy.
4. Compare total cost (item + shipping + tax), not just headline price.
5. Buy threshold:
   - Excellent: $499–$549
   - Good: $550–$599
   - Hold: $620+

## Follow-up when ready
- Run a fresh same-day sweep before buying (prices move quickly).
- If multiple options are close, prioritize seller quality + return policy over tiny price differences.
