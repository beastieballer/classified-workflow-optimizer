## Working Protocol Preferences
- Alex prefers proactive execution: once the next step is clear, proceed without waiting for repeated approval.
- Default venture build flow should run autonomously: name -> positioning -> landing page -> pitch deck.
- Provide concise updates with links to shipped assets, but avoid unnecessary permission checks for routine build steps.
- Continue to ask before sensitive/destructive/external actions.
- Mode toggle preference: when Alex says "mobile mode", prioritize concise replies and mobile-friendly live links.
