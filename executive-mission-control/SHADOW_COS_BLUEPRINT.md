# Shadow Chief of Staff Blueprint

## Mission
Create a private execution OS for Alex that turns strategy into daily shipped outcomes with minimal friction.

## Core Outcomes (Weekly)
- Qualified calls booked
- Proposals sent
- Paid pilots closed
- Revenue closed/advanced

## Operating Loops

2. Outreach -> Follow-up -> Booking loop
3. Build -> Log -> Optimize loop
4. Daily War Plan -> Execution -> Debrief loop

## Autonomy Rules
- Default execution mode is autonomous when next step is clear.
- Ask only for sensitive/external/destructive actions.
- Send concise progress updates every ~90 minutes only when meaningful output exists.

## 7-Day Pilot Targets
- 15 targeted outreaches
- 5 consult calls
- 2 proposals
- 1 paid pilot

## Dashboard Requirements
- Mobile-first UX
- Actionable KPI cards with drilldown detail
