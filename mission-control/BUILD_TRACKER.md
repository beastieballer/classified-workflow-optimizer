# BUILD TRACKER

## Active Venture: ClearedConnect.io
- **Current Stage:** BUILD
- **Owner:** Alex + Rock
- **Objective:** generate qualified scope calls and first brokered deals

## Current Assets
- [x] Landing page v1 live locally (`clearedconnect/`)
- [x] Intake form with readiness scoring
- [x] GA4 tracking hooks added
- [x] CRM endpoint wiring points added

## This Week’s Build Milestones
1. Optimize live public page for conversion (trust stack + booking CTA)
2. Connect intake -> CRM
3. Run outreach sprint (20 contacts)
4. Book first 3-5 calls
5. Close first brokered project

## Expansion Track A: SCIF Accreditation Velocity Office (AVO)
- **Current Stage:** VALIDATE
- **Objective (14 days):** close 1 paid accreditation-readiness pilot
- **Offer v0:** package triage, artifact checklist, authority-ready handoff brief

### AVO Milestones
1. Publish 1-page mini-deck + one-pager offer
2. Conduct 5 discovery calls (PMs/security managers)
3. Identify top 3 recurring bottlenecks across calls
4. Convert 1 “urgent package rescue” into paid pilot

## Expansion Track B: AccessFlow 48 (SCIF Access Sequencing Concierge)
- **Current Stage:** VALIDATE
- **Objective (10 days):** close 1 paid “Access Rescue Sprint” pilot
- **Offer v0:** access dependency map, badging/escort sequencing, daily unblock cadence

### AccessFlow Milestones
1. Publish mini-deck + one-page sprint offer
2. Conduct 6 discovery calls (PM/FSO/facility security)
3. Capture top 3 recurring access-delay patterns
4. Convert 1 active delayed project into paid pilot

## Expansion Track C: ShieldSpec Preflight QA (ICD-705 Package Triage)
- **Current Stage:** VALIDATE
- **Objective (10 days):** close 1 paid preflight triage sprint

4. Convert 1 active at-risk package into paid triage pilot

## Blockers / Risks
- CRM endpoint not yet live
- ClearedConnect outreach script + segmentation still incomplete
- AVO positioning must avoid over-claiming authority/accreditation outcomes
- AccessFlow claims must stay in coordination lane (not government authority promises)

## Notes
- Model policy: default Codex; ask Alex before model switching during active conversation.
- Mission Control now running four lanes: ClearedConnect BUILD + AVO VALIDATE + AccessFlow VALIDATE + ShieldSpec Preflight QA VALIDATE.
