# BUILD TRACKER

## Active Venture: ClearedConnect.io
- **Current Stage:** BUILD
- **Owner:** Alex + Rook
- **Objective:** generate qualified scope calls and first brokered deals

## Current Assets
- [x] Landing page v1 live locally (`clearedconnect/`)
- [x] Intake form with readiness scoring
- [x] GA4 tracking hooks added
- [x] CRM endpoint wiring points added
- [ ] Airtable/HubSpot endpoint deployed
- [ ] Domain DNS + hosting deployed
- [ ] First 20-contact outreach sprint completed
- [x] Mission Control dashboard (visual cockpit) created

## This Week’s Build Milestones
1. Optimize live public page for conversion (trust stack + booking CTA)
2. Connect intake -> CRM
3. Run outreach sprint (20 contacts)
4. Book first 3-5 calls
5. Close first brokered project

## Expansion Track: SCIF Accreditation Velocity Office (AVO)
- **Current Stage:** VALIDATE
- **Objective (14 days):** close 1 paid accreditation-readiness pilot
- **Offer v0:** package triage, artifact checklist, authority-ready handoff brief

### AVO Milestones
1. Publish 1-page mini-deck + one-pager offer
2. Conduct 5 discovery calls (PMs/security managers)
3. Identify top 3 recurring bottlenecks across calls
4. Convert 1 “urgent package rescue” into paid pilot

## Blockers / Risks
- CRM endpoint not yet live
- ClearedConnect outreach script + segmentation still incomplete
- AVO positioning must avoid over-claiming authority/accreditation outcomes

## Notes
- Model policy: default Codex; ask Alex before model switching during active conversation.
- Mission Control now running dual-track: ClearedConnect BUILD + AVO VALIDATE.
