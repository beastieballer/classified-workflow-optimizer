## Contact 1 — PM (Defense Integrator)
Subject: Quick help for ICD-705 package churn

Hi {{FirstName1}} — quick note.

I’m running a fixed-scope 5-day **Preflight QA Sprint** for teams with active ICD-705 package friction (missing artifacts, cross-doc inconsistencies, avoidable rework).

If useful, I can share the one-pager and do a **20-min fit call** this week.
Would {{Today 2:30 PM ET}} or {{Tomorrow 9:30 AM ET}} work?

## Contact 2 — FSO (Gov Contractor)
Subject: Fast triage lane for package rework risk

Hi {{FirstName2}},

I just packaged a short 5-day sprint to catch package gaps before they trigger another review cycle.

Deliverables are simple: completeness check, consistency scan, readiness score, and owner-assigned fix plan.

Open to a quick fit call this week? {{Today 4:00 PM ET}} or {{Tomorrow 10:00 AM ET}}?

## Contact 4 — PM (SCIF Retrofit Program)
Subject: Thought of your team re: package velocity

Hi {{FirstName4}},

If submission quality is still creating timeline pressure, this may help: 5 business days, fixed scope, actionable output.

No long consulting cycle — just triage and execution clarity.

Worth a 20-minute check this week? {{Today 5:00 PM ET}} or {{Tomorrow 1:00 PM ET}}.
