# ShieldSpec Preflight QA Sprint (5 Business Days)

## What this is
A fixed-scope, rapid **ICD-705 package readiness triage** to reduce first-pass rejections, review churn, and schedule slip.

This is a **support + coordination service**. We do not represent ourselves as the approving authority.

---

## Problem we solve
SCIF accreditation packages often stall because of:
- Missing required artifacts
- Inconsistent references across documents
- Poor sequencing of dependencies and approvals
- Last-minute discovery of avoidable gaps

Result: schedule delays, extra coordination cycles, and higher project cost.

---

## Deliverables (fixed scope)
1. **Artifact Completeness Review**  
   - Required-item checklist by package type and project stage
2. **Cross-Reference Consistency Scan**  
   - Mismatch/gap review across key documents and supporting records
3. **Submission Readiness Score (0-100)**  
   - Red/Yellow/Green status + prioritized remediation list
4. **5-Day Action Plan**  
   - Owner-assigned fix plan with sequence and due dates
5. **30-Minute Handoff Brief**  
   - Review findings, risk hotspots, and go-forward recommendations

---

## Timeline & SLA
- **Kickoff:** within 24 hours of intake + document access
- **Initial findings:** by end of Business Day 2
- **Final report + handoff:** by end of Business Day 5
- **Response SLA during sprint:** same-business-day response window

## Pricing (pilot)
- **Starter Triage** (single package, moderate complexity): **$3,500**

Optional rush start available based on capacity.

---

## Boundaries / compliance-safe language

- We do **not** grant approvals, certifications, or authority determinations.
- Final submission decisions and authority interactions remain with client-designated stakeholders.

---

## Ideal buyer profile
- PMs leading active SCIF upgrades/new build packages
- FSOs/security coordinators managing accreditation documentation
- Subcontractors under deadline pressure from package rework

---

## Success metrics
- Reduced review-cycle count
- Faster package readiness turnaround
- Fewer late-stage documentation surprises
- Clear owner-based remediation execution

## Call to action
If you have an active package at risk of delay, book a **20-minute Preflight Fit Call**.  
Goal: confirm fit, complexity tier, and kickoff path in one conversation.
