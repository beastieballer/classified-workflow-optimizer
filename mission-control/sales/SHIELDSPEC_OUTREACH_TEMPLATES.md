# ShieldSpec Preflight QA — Outreach Templates

## 1) Initial outreach (PM/FSO/security coordinator)
Subject: Quick help for ICD-705 package churn

Hi {{FirstName}} — quick note.

I’m running a fixed-scope **5-day Preflight QA Sprint** for teams with active ICD-705 package friction (missing artifacts, cross-doc inconsistencies, avoidable rework).

It’s designed to reduce review churn fast:
- completeness check
- consistency scan
- readiness score + prioritized fix plan
- 30-min handoff

If useful, I can share the one-pager and do a **20-min fit call** this week.  
Would {{Option A}} or {{Option B}} work?

## 2) Warmer version (existing relationship)
Subject: Thought of you — fast package triage lane

{{FirstName}}, seeing the same pattern repeatedly: teams lose time on package rework that should’ve been caught earlier.

I just packaged a **ShieldSpec Preflight QA Sprint** (5 business days, fixed scope) for exactly this:
- artifact completeness
- cross-reference consistency
- readiness score + owner-based fix plan

No fluff, no platform migration — just a rapid triage sprint to get package quality up before submission loops.

Want me to send the one-pager?

## 3) Follow-up (no reply after 48h)
Subject: Re: quick ICD-705 package support option

Hi {{FirstName}} — circling back once.

If package quality/rework is a live pain point, this sprint may help:  
**5 days, fixed scope, actionable outputs** (not a long consulting cycle).

Happy to do a brief fit check and tell you quickly if it’s a bad fit.

Open to a 20-min call on {{Option A}} or {{Option B}}?

## 4) Text message version
{{FirstName}} — I launched a 5-day Preflight QA sprint for ICD-705 package friction (missing artifacts/inconsistencies/rework). Fast triage + readiness score + fix plan. Worth a 20-min fit call this week?

## 5) Call opener script (first 2 minutes)
“Thanks for making time. Quick context: I’m helping teams reduce accreditation package churn before submission by running a fixed 5-day preflight QA sprint. This is support/coordination work — not authority-side approval work. If we’re not a fit, I’ll tell you in this call. If we are, I’ll map scope tier and start path.”

---

## 6) Discovery questions (validation + close)
1. Where are packages currently stalling most often?
2. Which artifact gaps trigger the most rework cycles?
3. What’s your current timeline risk if this slips 2-4 weeks?
4. Who owns final package assembly today?
5. What would “ready to submit” look like in your environment?
6. If we remove the top 3 friction points in 5 business days, what is that worth operationally?

---

## 7) Soft close
“Based on what you shared, I’d put this in the {{Starter/Complex}} tier. If you want, I can send a one-page scope + kickoff checklist today and we can start within 24 hours.”
