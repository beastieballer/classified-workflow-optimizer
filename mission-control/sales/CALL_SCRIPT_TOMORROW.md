# Tomorrow Call Script (12–20 minutes)

## 1) Opener (30 sec)
"Appreciate you taking this. I’ll keep it short — I want to understand where accreditation/access sequencing is creating schedule drag, and see if our 2-week sprint is a fit."

## 2) Context Questions (4-6 min)
1. "Where are you losing the most time right now — package prep, access dependencies, or coordination handoffs?"
2. "What are the top 1-2 blockers you expect in the next 30 days?"
3. "Roughly what does a one-week delay cost your team/project?"

## 3) Mirror + Reframe (2 min)
"What I’m hearing is [X], [Y], [Z]. If we can remove those quickly, would that materially improve timeline confidence?"

## 4) Offer (2-3 min)
"We run a 2-week SCIF Schedule-Risk Sprint:
- rapid diagnostic,
- owner-based sequencing plan,
- blocker escalation workflow,
- and an executive-ready closeout brief.
Fixed scope, fixed timeline."

## 5) Close (2 min)
"If useful, I can send a one-page SOW and 3 pilot options. If it looks right, we lock a kickoff date this week."

## 6) Handle Objections
- **"Send info first"** → "Absolutely. I’ll send concise one-pager + pricing so you can react quickly."
- **"No budget"** → "Totally fair — we can start with the smallest pilot to prove ROI before expanding."
- **"Need internal approval"** → "Great, let’s arm you with a tight summary and success criteria for approvals."

## 7) CTA before hang-up
"Can we hold a provisional kickoff window for next week while you review?"
