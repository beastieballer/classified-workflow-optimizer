# SCIF Vendor Mobilization Command (VMC)

## One-liner
De-risk SCIF vendor start dates by running a 7-day mobilization readiness command sprint before any specialty team hits site.

## The Problem
Projects choose the right vendor, then still lose weeks in the final mobilization mile:
- Badging and visit requests lag
- Escort windows conflict with site sequence
- Material/doc approvals are incomplete
- Site prerequisites are missing at go-live

## Why This Matters
Every delayed mobilization wave compounds schedule pressure, burns PM trust, and creates margin leakage from resequencing and idle labor.

## Offer (v0)
**Vendor Mobilization Sprint (7 days)**
- Pre-mob readiness checklist + risk heatmap
- Owner matrix (PM / FSO / vendor / superintendent)
- Daily mobilization command cadence
- Go / no-go gates by trade + date

## Who Pays
- Prime/sub PM teams running SCIF upgrades
- Procurement + security stakeholders needing predictable starts

## Pricing Hypothesis
- Sprint fee: $6k-$15k per mobilization wave (scope-dependent)
- Add-on command support: $2k-$5k/week during active wave

## 72-Hour Validation Plan
1. Publish one-page sprint offer with concrete deliverables/SLA
2. Run 5 discovery calls (PM, procurement, FSO, superintendent, vendor PM)
3. Pre-sell 1 paid sprint for a mobilization window inside 30 days

## Success Signal
A buyer pays to avoid one delayed mobilization wave before it happens.
