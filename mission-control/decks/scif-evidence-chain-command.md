# SCIF Evidence Chain Command (ECC)

## 1) Thesis
SCIF programs lose days to weeks at closeout because critical evidence (tests, witness logs, photos, redlines, deficiency closures) is not organized into a defensible, authority-ready chain. ECC is a fast-turn command service that restores evidence discipline so projects can close without scramble.

## 2) Pain We Solve
- Evidence is split across email, shared drives, texts, and contractor laptops
- No single owner map for who must produce which artifact by when
- Late-stage closeout stalls trigger schedule slips, margin erosion, and credibility hits

## 3) v0 Offer: “Evidence Chain Rescue Sprint” (10 days)
- Day 1-2: Artifact inventory + required-evidence matrix
- Day 3-4: Naming/versioning protocol + source-of-truth structure
- Day 5-7: Owner-assigned closure queue + daily unblock cadence
- Day 8-10: Authority-ready handoff packet draft + risk brief

## 4) Buyer + Pricing Hypothesis
- **Primary buyers:** PM, commissioning lead, FSO/security manager, facility modernization lead
- **Pilot price:** $12k-$25k per rescue sprint (complexity/site count dependent)
- **Expansion:** monthly retainer for multi-project evidence governance

## 5) Why Alex Wins
- Deep SCIF execution context + credibility with cleared stakeholders
- Can translate field reality into disciplined documentation rhythms
- Natural extension of ClearedConnect labor trust + ShieldSpec scope rigor

## 6) 72-Hour Validation Plan
1. Publish one-page offer with concrete deliverables and SLA
2. Run 5 discovery calls on active projects with closeout pressure
3. Pre-sell 1 paid sprint where evidence currently spans >=3 disconnected systems
4. Capture top 3 recurring evidence-failure patterns to sharpen positioning

## 7) Guardrails
ECC does **not** claim certifying authority or adjudication power. Positioning stays in coordination, traceability, and document-control execution support.
