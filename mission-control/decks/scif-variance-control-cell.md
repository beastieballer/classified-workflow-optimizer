# SCIF Variance Control Cell (VCC)
## Mini-Deck (One Page)

### 1) The Problem
SCIF programs lose weeks when waivers, deviations, and interpretation variances are managed through disconnected email threads and ad hoc meetings. Critical decisions stall without clear owners, dependency visibility, or adjudication rhythm.

### 2) The Offer (v0)
**VCC = variance/deviation command operations for active secure projects**
- Standardized variance intake + severity triage rubric
- Decision dependency map (technical, security, contractual owners)
- Weekly adjudication command brief with hard due dates
- Owner-assigned closure queue and escalation path

### 3) ICP + Trigger Events
**Ideal Buyers:** Program PM, FSO, accred/security representative, superintendent, contracting lead.
**Best Trigger Signals:**
- >=3 unresolved variances/deviations older than 14 days
- Repeated field stoppages awaiting interpretation/approval
- Change-order backlog linked to unresolved security variances
- Milestone risk within next 30-45 days

### 4) Why We Win
- Field-trusted SCIF execution credibility with practical coordination discipline
- Strong adjacency to ClearedConnect labor lane + ShieldSpec package rigor
- Fast, service-led deployment (no heavy software build needed)
- Immediate value: decision velocity, fewer idle crews, lower schedule burn

### 5) Business Model
- **Pilot:** 10-day “Variance Rescue Sprint” (fixed fee)
- **Recurring:** monthly command-cell retainer for active portfolios
- **Expansion:** multi-site variance analytics + executive risk reporting

### 6) 10-Day Validation Plan
1. Publish one-page offer with deliverables/SLA
2. Run 5 targeted discovery calls (PM/FSO/security/superintendent/contracting)
3. Capture top 3 recurring adjudication bottlenecks
4. Pre-sell 1 paid sprint on an active delayed project

### 7) Pilot Success Metrics
- Median variance decision cycle time reduced by >=30%
- Aged unresolved variance queue (>14 days) reduced by >=40%
- 100% of critical variances assigned to named owner + due date
- Weekly decision-risk heatmap adopted by project leadership

### 8) Positioning Guardrails
VCC does **not** make certifying authority decisions or provide legal advice. It is an execution and coordination layer that improves variance throughput, documentation integrity, and schedule protection.
