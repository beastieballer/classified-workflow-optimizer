# SCIF Commissioning Readiness Cell (CRC)
## 1-Page Mini-Deck

## 1) Problem
SCIF projects frequently miss planned turnover dates even after construction appears complete. Failure points cluster in the final 30 days:
- Punch-list items are tracked in multiple disconnected tools
- Witness/test events are sequenced late or out of order
- Closeout artifacts are incomplete at authority handoff
- Teams discover dependency misses only during final validation

Result: expensive schedule slippage, idle cleared labor, and loss of stakeholder confidence.

## 2) Solution
**SCIF Commissioning Readiness Cell (CRC)** is a tactical go-live rescue sprint for projects in their final mile.

**Core Offer (10-day sprint):**
1. Turnover Readiness Board (single source of truth)
2. Witness/Test Sequence Plan (dependency-mapped)
3. Closeout Artifact Command List (owner + due date + status)
4. Daily 15-minute unblock cadence with escalation routing

## 3) Why Now
- Federal/defense project pressure is increasing while delivery windows tighten
- Accreditation and commissioning delays create disproportionate downstream cost
- Most teams have staffing + docs, but no integrated final-mile orchestration

## 4) ICP + Beachhead
**Ideal Customer Profile:**
- PMs, facility/security leads, and integrators on active SCIF projects
- Projects within **0-30 days** of commissioning or authority review
- Programs already showing turnover friction (failed tests, artifact gaps, schedule drift)

**Beachhead motion:**
- Sell as emergency “Go-Live Rescue Sprint”
- Land with one delayed project, expand to portfolio continuity retainer

## 5) Business Model
- **Pilot:** Fixed-fee 10-day sprint
- **Expansion:** Monthly readiness/continuity retainer for repeat programs
- **Upsell path:** Feeds into AccessFlow coordination + ShieldSpec quality lanes

## 6) Wedge + Defensibility
- Real-world SCIF execution context (not generic PM consulting)
- Integrates labor, sequencing, and artifact readiness in one lane
- Creates proprietary turnover failure-pattern data across projects

## 7) 14-Day Validation Plan
1. Publish one-pager with deliverables + pricing bands
2. Run 5 discovery calls (PM, security, commissioning)
3. Document top 3 recurring turnover blockers
4. Pre-sell 1 paid sprint tied to an active final-30-day project

## 8) Success Metrics
- 1 paid pilot closed in 14 days
- 20%+ reduction in open critical turnover blockers by day 7
- On-time witness/test completion rate improvement
- Closeout artifact completeness at handoff

## 9) Key Risks + Boundaries
- Must avoid claiming authority decisions or accreditation outcomes
- Positioning stays in orchestration/readiness support lane
- Requires strong daily customer participation to drive unblock speed

## 10) Ask
Approve immediate validation sprint:
- Send 5-target outreach batch today
- Run first 3 calls in next 48 hours
- Aim to close first paid CRC pilot this cycle
