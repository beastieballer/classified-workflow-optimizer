# SCIF Operations Readiness Academy (ORA) Mini-Deck

## Problem
SCIF personnel arrive on-site without standardized training on security protocols, emergency procedures, equipment operation constraints, and coordination handoffs, causing incidents and delays.

## Solution
Fixed-fee site-readiness training program design, per-person certification delivery, incident-reduction tracking, and certification validity management.

## Business Model
- Fixed-fee training design sprint
- Per-person certification course fees
- Monthly retainer for ongoing certification management
- Premium incident-response re-training sprints

## Why We Can Win
Alex's trusted relationships with security/facility stakeholders and cleared operators enable operator-led, site-specific readiness certification that reduces incidents.

## Key Milestones
- Draft one-page offer with training scope, delivery format, and incident-reduction value proposition
- Identify 5 active sites with incident pressure or upcoming inspection cycles
- Conduct 5 discovery calls to capture readiness failure patterns
- Pre-sell 1 paid pilot tied to a high-incident or pre-inspection site

## Expansion Potential
Strong ongoing demand for standardized site readiness training across secure facilities.

## Next Steps
Focused outreach and pilot pre-sell to validate demand and refine training program.
