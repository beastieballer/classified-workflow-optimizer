# SCIF Decommissioning Assurance Cell (DAC)

## 1) Core Thesis
SCIF programs carry hidden schedule, compliance, and reputational risk at end-of-life transitions. DAC is a rapid command layer that turns chaotic closure/relocation events into controlled, evidence-backed decommissioning outcomes.

## 2) Problem We Solve
- Sanitization and removal tasks are executed without a single owner rhythm
- Asset disposition paperwork and chain-of-custody evidence are fragmented
- Closeout packages are assembled late, creating review delays and rework
- Program teams lack a practical command cadence during closure windows

## 3) Offer (v0)
**Decommissioning Assurance Sprint (10 days)**
- Day 1-2: Decommissioning intake + risk map
- Day 3-5: Sanitization evidence and asset disposition control plane
- Day 6-8: Owner-assigned closure queue + daily command brief
- Day 9-10: Authority-ready closeout packet and final risk brief

## 4) Ideal Buyer + Trigger
- **Buyer:** PM, FSO, facility security lead, accountable/property officer
- **Trigger Events:** relocation, renovation turnover, site closure, mission transition in <=45 days

## 5) Business Model
- Fixed-fee sprint per site transition
- Premium command support for high-urgency cutovers
- Portfolio retainer for organizations with recurring site lifecycle events

## 6) 72-Hour Validation Plan
1. Publish one-page sprint offer + compliance-safe scope boundaries
2. Run 5 discovery calls across PM/FSO/facility-security roles
3. Pre-sell 1 paid sprint on an active closure or relocation event

## 7) Positioning Guardrails
DAC does **not** claim certifying, adjudication, or destruction authority. It operates in execution orchestration, evidence traceability, and closeout readiness support.
