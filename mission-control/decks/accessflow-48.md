## SCIF Access Sequencing Concierge

### 1) The Pain
SCIF projects don’t usually fail on technical scope first — they fail on **access choreography**:
- Badges submitted late or with missing data
- Escort dependencies not mapped to work windows
- Required trainings/briefs not completed in sequence
- Cleared crews arriving before access is truly ready

Result: expensive idle labor, missed milestones, and schedule distrust.

### 2) The Offer (v0)
**Access Rescue Sprint (2 weeks)** for active delayed projects:
- Access dependency map (people, approvals, training, escort, site windows)
- 14-day sequencing plan with owner-by-owner accountability
- Daily unblock standup + escalation matrix
- End-of-sprint readiness report for leadership

### 3) Why Now
Federal + defense project timelines are tightening while secure-site friction is increasing. Teams need a specialist lane that de-risks schedule execution without adding heavy tooling overhead.

### 4) Why Alex Wins
- Real SCIF operator credibility (not generic consulting)
- Trusted relationships across security-sensitive stakeholders
- Ability to pair staffing reality (ClearedConnect) with schedule coordination

### 5) Business Model
- **Pilot:** $7.5K-$15K per 2-week Access Rescue Sprint
- **Retainer:** $4K-$8K/month for ongoing multi-site programs
- **Expansion:** lightweight SaaS dashboard for access dependency tracking

### 6) 10-Day Validation Plan
1. Publish one-page offer + pilot SOW template
2. Run 6 interviews (PM, FSO, facility security)
3. Extract top 3 repeated access-delay patterns
4. Close 1 paid pilot on an already delayed project

### 7) Success Criteria
- One paid pilot closed
- One referenceable case study (days recovered / idle hours reduced)
- Repeatable offer language that can be sold in one call
