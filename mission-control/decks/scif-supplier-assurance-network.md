# SCIF Supplier Assurance Network (SSAN)

## 1) Thesis
SCIF projects regularly slip when specialty vendors arrive unready for secure-site realities (documentation gaps, badging/access friction, QA mismatches, unclear handoff artifacts). SSAN is a pre-execution readiness gate that de-risks vendor onboarding before schedule damage compounds.

## 2) Pain We Solve
- Specialty suppliers are selected on capability, not secure-readiness discipline
- PM/FSO teams discover compliance and documentation gaps too late
- Rework and sequencing failures create avoidable downtime, change-order churn, and margin leak

## 3) v0 Offer: “Supplier Readiness Sprint” (10-14 days)
- Day 1-2: Vendor intake + readiness rubric scoring
- Day 3-5: Secure documentation gate checklist + deficiency map
- Day 6-9: Owner-assigned corrective action queue + daily unblock rhythm
- Day 10-14: Go/No-Go brief with risk-ranked onboarding plan

## 4) Buyer + Pricing Hypothesis
- **Primary buyers:** PM, procurement lead, FSO, QA/QC lead, superintendent
- **Pilot price:** $10k-$22k per readiness sprint (vendor count/complexity dependent)
- **Expansion:** annual pre-vetted supplier membership + portfolio governance retainer

## 5) Why Alex Wins
- Trusted SCIF field operator perspective with direct visibility into recurring vendor failure patterns
- Ability to bridge procurement intent with execution reality and security requirements
- Strong adjacency with ClearedConnect (labor) and ShieldSpec (scope/package discipline)

## 6) 72-Hour Validation Plan
1. Publish one-page offer with readiness rubric and gate SLA
2. Run 5 discovery calls across PM/procurement/FSO/QA-QC stakeholders
3. Pre-sell 1 paid sprint on an active project with >=2 at-risk specialty vendors
4. Capture top 3 supplier-readiness failure patterns to sharpen ICP and messaging

## 7) Guardrails
SSAN does **not** claim government-approved vendor authority, procurement favoritism, or certifying power. Positioning remains readiness screening, documentation quality, and execution-risk transparency support.
