# SCIF Accreditation Velocity Office (AVO) — Mini Deck

## 1) Opportunity
SCIF programs lose weeks in accreditation prep because scope artifacts, installer inputs, and authority-facing packages are fragmented across teams.

## 2) Offer
A 2-week “Accreditation Sprint” service that compresses readiness work into a structured, buyer-visible delivery cadence.

### Core Modules
- **Package Triage:** rapid gap scan of current accreditation artifacts
- **Artifact Factory:** standardized checklist + owner mapping + due dates
- **Authority-Ready Brief:** concise handoff packet for decision-makers/review bodies

## 3) Buyer
- Prime contractor PMs running secure facility upgrades
- Security/facility managers accountable for readiness timelines
- Subcontractor teams inheriting distressed SCIF packages

## 4) Revenue Model
- Fixed-fee 2-week sprint ($15k-$35k, complexity-based)
- Add-on monthly retainer for package maintenance and change tracking
- Premium “rescue sprint” pricing for schedule-critical programs

## 5) 14-Day Validation Sprint
1. Publish one-page offer + scope boundaries
2. Run 5 discovery calls and log repeated bottlenecks
3. Pre-sell 1 paid pilot with explicit success criteria
4. Deliver first sprint and capture before/after cycle-time evidence

## 6) Why This Fits Existing Ventures
- **ClearedConnect:** supplies surge cleared labor when package gaps require field execution
- **ShieldSpec:** contributes structured scope discipline and documentation rigor
- **AVO:** monetizes schedule certainty at the accreditation bottleneck layer
## Security & Confidentiality Commitment
- All client emails, blueprints, package artifacts, and site documentation are handled as sensitive information
- Need-to-know access and controlled sharing only with authorized stakeholders
- Confidentiality-first operating protocol across intake, delivery, and follow-up
