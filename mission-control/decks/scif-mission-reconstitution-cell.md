# SCIF Mission Reconstitution Cell (MRC)

## 1) Problem (High-Cost Recovery Gap)
SCIF programs routinely lose days or weeks after a failed inspection, outage, security incident, or stop-work event because recovery ownership is fragmented across PM, FSO, facility, vendors, and commissioning teams.

## 2) Solution (Return-to-Mission Sprint)
A fixed 10-day recovery command service that restores execution rhythm fast:
- 72-hour stabilization plan (critical path + owner map)
- Daily command brief (blockers, decisions, next-24h actions)
- Documentation remediation queue (evidence + closure artifacts)
- Re-entry readiness gate for controlled return to operations

## 3) ICP + Buyer
- **ICP:** Active SCIF build/upgrade/renovation programs in disruption or post-failure state
- **Economic Buyer:** Program Manager / Contracts Lead
- **Operational Champions:** FSO, Facility Security, Commissioning Lead, Superintendent

## 4) Business Model
- Fixed-fee 10-day Reconstitution Sprint
- Premium incident-response activation for urgent cases
- Optional monthly readiness retainer for portfolio-level recovery preparedness

## 5) Why Now / Why Alex
- Downtime and recovery slippage are immediately visible in schedule and cost
- Alex has direct edge at the intersection of cleared labor coordination + secure documentation discipline
- Natural expansion from ClearedConnect and ShieldSpec into high-urgency, high-value recovery work

## 6) 72-Hour Validation Plan
1. Publish one-page “Return-to-Mission Sprint” offer with clear SLA
2. Run 5 discovery calls (PM, FSO, facility security, commissioning, program lead)
3. Pre-sell 1 paid sprint on an active outage/failed-inspection recovery case

## 7) Success Metrics (First 30 Days)
- 5 qualified recovery conversations
- 1 paid sprint closed
- Baseline proof points: days recovered, blockers cleared, closure artifact completion rate
