# SCIF Change Order Command (COC)
## One-Page Mini-Deck

### 1) The Problem
SCIF projects lose margin and schedule when late changes are handled ad hoc.
- Unresolved change orders pile up
- Pricing and risk assumptions stay inconsistent
- Approval packets are incomplete for secure stakeholder review
- Field teams execute out of sequence while waiting for decisions

**Result:** avoidable delay, margin leakage, and leadership fire drills.
