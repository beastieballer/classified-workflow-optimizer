# SCIF Knowledge Continuity Cell (KCC)

**One-page investor overview**

---

## The Problem

SCIF programs lose weeks—sometimes months—when cleared personnel rotate.

**Why it hurts:**
- Facility-specific protocols live in departed heads, not transferable docs
- Security procedures, vendor relationships, and operational constraints vanish with outgoing teams
- Incoming personnel repeat avoidable mistakes, trigger compliance gaps, and slow mission readiness
- No owner coordinates knowledge capture during high-pressure transitions

**Cost:** Every rotation creates 2-6 weeks of invisible rework, re-learning vendor quirks, and re-discovering undocumented constraints.

---

## The Solution

**SCIF Knowledge Continuity Cell (KCC):** A structured 14-day knowledge-transfer sprint that captures critical operational context from outgoing teams and delivers onboarding playbooks for incoming personnel.

**Core deliverables:**
1. **Protocol audit** — facility-specific security, access, and operational procedures
2. **Critical-path knowledge capture** — vendor relationships, undocumented constraints, lessons learned
3. **Onboarding playbook** — role-based checklists with 30/60/90-day competency checkpoints
4. **Handoff brief** — live transition meeting with outgoing/incoming leads + FSO/facility security

---

## Why We Win

**Founder edge:**
- Alex Potter has operational credibility with both departing operators and incoming teams
- Trusted to handle sensitive context without security leaks
- Direct access to PM/FSO/facility stakeholders during high-stakes transitions

**Market gap:**
- No existing service productizes knowledge capture for secure facilities
- Current "solution" = rushed email handoffs and tribal knowledge loss

---

## Business Model

**Revenue streams:**
1. **Knowledge Transfer Sprint:** $12K–$18K fixed fee (14-day engagement)
2. **Monthly retainer:** $3K–$5K for ongoing protocol documentation + playbook maintenance
3. **Enterprise portfolio retainer:** $8K–$15K/month for multi-site rotation governance

**Unit economics:**
- 70%+ gross margin (knowledge work, low overhead)
- Repeatable every personnel rotation (6–18 month cycles per facility)

---

## Traction Path

**Week 1:**
- Publish "Knowledge Transfer Sprint" one-pager
- Identify 5 active personnel transitions (PM/FSO rotating in <=45 days)

**Week 2:**
- Run 5 discovery calls (outgoing lead, incoming lead, FSO, facility security)
- Extract top 3 recurring knowledge-loss failure patterns

**Week 3:**
- Pre-sell 1 paid pilot sprint tied to urgent transition
- Deliver first handoff playbook and capture testimonial

---

## Expansion Potential

**Platform play:**
- Build library of anonymized SCIF protocol templates (reusable across facilities)
- Offer "SCIF Operator Certification" micro-credential tied to facility-specific onboarding completion
- Integrate with ClearedConnect (pre-vetted labor comes pre-trained on facility protocols)
- Cross-sell into SAC (sustainment teams reference living playbooks)

**Outcome:** Every SCIF rotation becomes a revenue event instead of a knowledge-loss crisis.
