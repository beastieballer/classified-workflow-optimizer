# SCIF Program Controls Nerve Center (PCNC)

## 1) The Pain
SCIF programs slip quietly before anyone calls it a crisis.
- Access sequencing drifts
- Change orders stack up
- Evidence/closeout artifacts fragment
- No single risk picture across PM, FSO, superintendent, and commissioning

Result: schedule loss, margin bleed, and authority-facing friction late in the cycle.

## 2) The Offer
**SCIF Program Controls Nerve Center (10-day sprint + optional retainer)**
- Unified SCIF risk board (access, scope, variance, evidence, closeout)
- Weekly command brief with owner-assigned closure queue
- 14-day look-ahead risk map and escalation triggers
- “Red Flag to Recovery” playbook for at-risk milestones

## 3) Why Alex Wins
- Field-trusted SCIF operator perspective (not generic PM software)
- Can bridge PM/FSO/facility/security language into one execution rhythm
- Direct adjacency to ClearedConnect labor activation + ShieldSpec documentation rigor

## 4) Monetization
- **Pilot:** Fixed-fee 10-day controls setup sprint
- **Core:** Monthly retainer per active program/site
- **Upsell:** Incident response add-on for red-status programs

## 5) Fast Validation (72 hours)
1. Publish one-page “Controls Setup Sprint” offer with explicit deliverables/SLA
2. Run 5 discovery calls (PM, FSO, facility security, superintendent, commissioning)
3. Pre-sell 1 paid pilot on a project with >2 active risk lanes

## 6) Compliance-Safe Positioning
- Not certifying authority
- Not contracting/legal adjudication
- Operates as execution-risk coordination + documentation discipline layer

## 7) Success Metrics
- Time-to-risk-escalation reduced
- Open red risks closed per week
- Fewer milestone slips from preventable coordination failures
- Faster authority-ready artifact packaging at handoff
