# SCIF Sustainment Assurance Cell (SAC)
## Mini-Deck (One Page)

### 1) The Problem
Most SCIF teams optimize for accreditation day, then lose readiness afterward. Open deficiencies, stale artifacts, and weak closure ownership create recurring inspection risk, unplanned downtime, and leadership fire drills.

### 2) The Offer (v0)
**SAC = recurring post-accreditation readiness operations**
- Deficiency command board (severity, owner, due date, closure proof)
- Weekly inspection-readiness pulse (what will fail next if not addressed)
- Artifact hygiene cadence (updates, cross-references, version controls)
- 30-day “readiness recovery sprint” for at-risk sites

### 3) ICP + Trigger Events
**Ideal Buyers:** FSO, SSM, facility manager, security compliance lead, program PM.
**Best Trigger Signals:**
- Upcoming inspection in <=90 days
- >5 open deficiencies older than 30 days
- Last review produced repeat findings
- Turnover of security/facility leadership causing process drift

### 4) Why We Win
- Trusted SCIF execution credibility (not theory)
- Natural adjacency to current scope/staffing coordination lanes
- Tangible weekly outcomes: closure velocity, inspection posture, fewer escalations
- Easy land-and-expand path: sprint -> recurring retainer

### 5) Business Model
- **Pilot:** 30-day sustainment readiness sprint (fixed fee)
- **Recurring:** monthly retainers per facility/site
- **Expansion:** multi-site portfolio oversight + quarterly executive readiness reviews

### 6) 14-Day Validation Plan
1. Publish one-page offer + strict deliverables/SLA
2. Run 5 discovery calls (FSO/SSM/facility/security)
3. Capture top 3 post-accreditation drift patterns
4. Pre-sell 1 paid 30-day pilot at an at-risk site

### 7) Proof Metrics for First Pilot
- Deficiency closure cycle time reduced by >=30%
- Aged backlog (>30 days) reduced by >=40%
- Weekly readiness score trendline established and improving
- Named owners + closure evidence on 100% of critical findings

### 8) Positioning Guardrails
SAC does **not** claim certifying authority decisions. It is an operations-and-readiness layer that improves documentation quality, closure discipline, and inspection preparedness.
