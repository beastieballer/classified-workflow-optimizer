## Slide 1 — Cover
**ShieldSpec**
Productized SCIF scope intelligence + execution readiness.

## Slide 2 — Problem
### Scope quality breaks secure-project execution
In SCIF-adjacent work, teams often operate from incomplete or non-operational scope packages:
- Missing access constraints and sequencing realities
- Underestimated compliance and site-control requirements
- Poor handoff from planning to field execution

**Result:** expensive change orders, schedule slippage, and compliance exposure.

---

## Slide 3 — Solution
### ShieldSpec: scope preflight + risk-ready work packages
Core offer:
1. **Scope Preflight Audit**
2. **Execution Readiness Package**
3. **Risk Flags + Mobilization Checklist**

ShieldSpec turns fragmented planning into a standardized, execution-ready package for secure facilities and contractors.
