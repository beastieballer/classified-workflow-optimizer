# SCIF Emanation Readiness Cell (ERC)
## One-Page Mini-Deck

### 1) The Problem (High Cost, Found Late)
SCIF programs frequently uncover emanation-control/TEMPEST readiness gaps too late in execution. When shielding assumptions, zoning details, or documentation traceability are incomplete, teams get stuck in redesign loops and authority review delays.

### 2) Why This Matters Now
- Late discovery creates schedule slips at the most expensive project phase
- PM/FSO/security teams often lack one owner for cross-functional closure
- Buyers already pay to avoid downtime, rework, and failed readiness events

### 3) ERC Offer (10-Day Sprint)
**Emanation Readiness Sprint**
- Rapid gap scan of current assumptions, artifacts, and dependencies
- Risk-ranked remediation queue with clear owners and deadlines
- Daily unblock cadence across PM/security/engineering stakeholders
- Authority-ready briefing pack (status, evidence, open-risk map)

### 4) ICP + Trigger Events
**Best-fit buyers:** PMs, security engineers, FSOs, facility security leads on active SCIF modernization/commissioning efforts.

**Trigger events:**
- Shielding or zoning assumptions being revisited late
- Conflicting design vs field reality signals
- Upcoming review milestone with unresolved technical/security artifacts

### 5) Business Model
- Fixed-fee 10-day sprint
- Optional premium remediation command support
- Portfolio retainer for multi-site programs

### 6) Go-to-Market (72 Hours)
1. Publish one-page ERC offer with SLA and clear non-authority positioning
2. Run 5 targeted discovery calls across PM/security/FSO personas
3. Pre-sell 1 paid sprint on a currently at-risk project

### 7) Positioning Guardrails (Compliance-Safe)
ERC does **not** act as certifier, adjudicator, or approving authority.
ERC operates in readiness triage, remediation orchestration, and documentation discipline to help project teams arrive prepared.

### 8) Success Metrics
- Time-to-risk visibility (days)
- % of high-risk gaps closed within sprint window
- Review-cycle compression (before vs after ERC intervention)
- Paid pilot conversion rate from discovery calls
