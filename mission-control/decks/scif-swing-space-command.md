# SCIF Swing Space Command (SSC)
## No-Downtime Cutover Sprint

### 1) Core Problem
SCIF renovations, relocations, and technology refreshes often fail at the transition moment: swing-space readiness is partial, dependency owners are unclear, and phased cutovers create mission-impacting downtime.

### 2) v0 Offer (14-Day Sprint)
- Swing-space readiness audit (access, infrastructure, documentation, staffing)
- Phased cutover dependency map with critical-path ownership
- Day-by-day cutover command cadence (standups, unblock queue, escalation path)
- Go/no-go gate checklist and rollback triggers for each cutover window

### 3) Ideal Buyer + Trigger
**Buyer:** Program manager, facility/security lead, or transition owner at primes/subs supporting secure modernization work.
**Trigger:** Active SCIF renovation/relocation with date pressure, unresolved dependencies, or executive concern about downtime risk.

### 4) Business Model
- Fixed-fee cutover planning sprint
- Premium add-on for live cutover command support
- Portfolio retainer for multi-site modernization programs

### 5) Why We Win
- Trusted execution reputation in classified environments
- Combines labor access, scope discipline, and operational sequencing
- Sells on measurable risk reduction before transition day
