# Personal Scoreboard

Personal operating system aligned to Mission Control scoreboard logic.

## Purpose
A single place to track:
- Personal goals worth prioritizing
- Active personal projects and execution status
- Weekly priorities and daily actions
- Habit/rhythm performance signals

## Files
- `GOAL_VAULT.md` — personal goals pipeline + scorecards
- `BUILD_TRACKER.md` — active personal projects and blockers
- `ACTION_BOARD.md` — today/this-week personal execution list
- `METRICS_LOG.md` — weekly personal metrics
- `ACTIVITY_LOG.md` — personal progress timeline
- `goals.md` — 90-day outcome targets (north-star outcomes)

## Operating Rhythm
- **Daily:** update `ACTION_BOARD.md`
- **2-3x per week:** update `BUILD_TRACKER.md`
- **Weekly (Sunday):** update `METRICS_LOG.md`
- **As goals evolve:** update `GOAL_VAULT.md`

## Status Key
- `IDEA` — possible goal, not committed
- `VALIDATE` — trial period active
- `BUILD` — building the routine/system
- `LIVE` — habit/routine is stable and running
- `PAUSE` — parked intentionally
- `KILL` — archived and closed
