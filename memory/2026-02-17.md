## Session Notes

- First real working session with Alex
- Switched default model from Opus to Sonnet 4 (save costs for everyday chat, Opus for heavy lifting)
- Set up Venture Architect persona in SOUL.md
- Alex shared his full background:
  - 30+ years in window film, deep classified/SCIF work (DOD, Pentagon, White House)
  - Signals Defense products specialist
  - Side project: Forecast AI Consultant (AI for trades) — market getting flooded
  - Wants to brainstorm original, differentiated AI business ideas
  - Open to any industry, not just window film
- Alex's constraints:
  - Budget: $20K from investors, tight personal cash
  - Time: Full-time available, work has slowed
  - Can run multiple projects simultaneously
  - Revenue target: $500K-$1M+ year one, several million possible
  - Wants revenue within 30-60 days
  - Willing to take bigger swings
- Next: brainstorm session for business ideas
- Mission Control mobile access issue: local HTTP server start failed with `Exec failed ... code 1` (socket bind error), indicating port conflict/occupied listener. Action pattern: check active process/port before restart and use alternate port if needed.
