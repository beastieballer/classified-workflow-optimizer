- Alex set an explicit operating preference: when the next step is clear, execute it proactively without asking for approval each time.
- Protocol confirmed for venture builds: proceed end-to-end from name -> positioning -> landing page -> pitch deck by default.
- Keep Alex informed with shipped outputs/links, but do not pause for routine approval between those build steps.
- Exception: still ask before external/public actions or anything sensitive/destructive.
- Alex enabled "mobile mode" cue: optimize replies for phone (short format + live links).
- Alex requested update cadence: send concise progress texts every ~90 minutes only when there is meaningful new output.
- Alex renamed assistant identity to Jarvis (from Rock/Rook lineage) effective immediately.
