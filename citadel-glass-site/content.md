## Compliance-Safe Language Block

Citadel Glass solutions are intended to improve privacy, reduce visibility, and strengthen glass performance characteristics. No film or installation method can guarantee prevention of forced entry, eliminate all risk, or replace comprehensive physical security planning. Performance depends on glass type, frame condition, installation quality, and event-specific factors.

## FAQ

### Who is this designed for?
Citadel Glass is purpose-built for executive households, family offices, and principals who require discreet residential hardening with high service standards.

### Is this only for luxury homes?
Our work is best suited to properties where privacy, discretion, and precision execution are mission-critical—not simply aesthetic upgrades.

### What does “discreet” look like in practice?
Discretion includes controlled communications, secure intake, tight scheduling windows, professional on-site protocol, and a low-visibility operating posture.

### How quickly can projects start?
Timelines vary by scope and material availability. Expedited scheduling may be available for qualified engagements.

### Do your films make glass “unbreakable”?
No. Security films are designed to improve glass retention and delay breach progression in many scenarios, but they do not make glass indestructible or guarantee specific outcomes.

### Can you coordinate with estate managers or security teams?
Yes. We regularly coordinate with executive assistants, chiefs of staff, estate managers, and security stakeholders under defined protocol.

### Do you offer ongoing support?
Yes. Depending on tier, support can include check-ins, maintenance guidance, and priority service pathways.
